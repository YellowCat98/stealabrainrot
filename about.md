# Steal a brainrot

## ModTober25 (What The Heck!?) Submission!

- Be able to STEAL brainrots while playing geometry dash levels!
- Brainrots are an unknown/unresearched species which nobody barely anything about.
- Read below to understand how to steal and raise a brainrot.

## Stealing Brainrots
- Brainrots follow Geometry Dash characters' scent.
- Playing a level will cause your character to leave a trail of scent.
- Tracing back your steps will allow you to find and catch them.

## Raising Brainrots
- Much like any living organism, brainrots need food too.
- Brainrots feed on stars or moons you collect.
- Their digestive system works in a way that causes your stars/moons to not get wasted and will not get turned into feces.
- As you give them more stars/moons, they start aging, **here are all the ages**:
- **Baby**: When you first catch a brainrot, this will be its initial age.
- **Child**: Your brainrot becomes a child once it has been fed 5 stars/moons.
- **TikTok User**: Your brainrot becomes a TikTok user once it has been fed 10 stars/moons.
- **Teenager**: Your brainrot becomes a Teenager once it has been fed 15 stars/moons.
- **Adult**: Your brainrot becomes an Adult once it has been fed 20 stars/moons.
- Once a brainrot becomes an adult, it will remain at that age forever as brainrots are an immortal species.
- You can own more than one of the same brainrot, but it will be treated as a separate brainrot, you can distinguish which one is which by the roman numeral after their name in the Brainrot Lair.
- If you do not feed a brainrot for **48 hours**, it will run away. However if it is a TikTok User brainrot, it will run away after **24 hours** instead of 48 hours of not being fed, so please alternate between equipping brainrots to ensure they are all fed.
- After catching a brainrot, it will not wander around your screen immediately due to the fact they hide from new owners, in order for them to appear, restart your game.

## Note:
- this mod has settings btw


**some fun stuff i wanted to throw into the description**
- DID YOU KNOW: at January 19, 2038, 03:14:07 UTC, this mod will not work properly as it relies on Unix Timestamp (this is assuming you dont upgrade your device to a newer one.)
- DID YOU KNOW (part 2): after earning roughly 2.8 trillion brainrots, trying to earn another brainrot will cause your game to freeze, as it relies on generating random 8 character strings. though realistically, your game won't be able to handle a lot of brainrots, and even if it did it would be increasingly harder to keep them all from running away.
