- Read below to understand how to steal and raise a brainrot.

## Stealing Brainrots
- Brainrots follow Geometry Dash characters' scent.
- Playing a level will cause your character to leave a trail of scent.
- Tracing back your steps will allow you to find and catch them.

## Raising Brainrots
- Much like any living organism, brainrots need food too.
- Brainrots feed on stars or moons you collect.
- Their digestive system works in a way that causes your stars/moons to not get wasted and will not get turned into feces.
- As you give them more stars/moons, they start aging, **here are all the ages**:
- **Baby**: When you first catch a brainrot, this will be its initial age.
- **Child**: Your brainrot becomes a child once it has been fed 5 stars/moons.
- **TikTok User**: Your brainrot becomes a TikTok user once it has been fed 10 stars/moons.
- **Teenager**: Your brainrot becomes a Teenager once it has been fed 15 stars/moons.
- **Adult**: Your brainrot becomes an Adult once it has been fed 20 stars/moons.
- Once a brainrot becomes an adult, it will remain at that age forever as brainrots are an immortal species.
